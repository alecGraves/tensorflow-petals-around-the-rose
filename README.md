This is a project I started as an introduction to tensorflow.

# Petals Around the Rose
Petals Around the Rose is a mathematical logic/puzzle game. To play the game, you roll five dice and ask someone who has already figured out the puzzle what the score is for that collection of dice. I created a progeam that learns the solution to the puzzle given a large collection of sample rolls and scores.

Check out [this](http://www.borrett.id.au/computing/petals-j.htm) link for an in-depth introduction to the puzzle.
